**WHAT IS THIS?**

These are test programs for our interpreter project. They check if the code works right.



**WHAT YOU NEED**

Your project should have these files already:



memory.c and memory.h



parser.c and parser.h



executor.c and executor.h



errors.c and errors.h



QUICK START (EASIEST WAY)



**1. COPY FILES**

Copy ALL these files into your project folder (same place as your .c files):



test\_runner.exe (START WITH THIS ONE)



tests\_memory.exe



tests\_parser.exe



tests\_executor.exe



tests\_integration.exe



All the .txt files (executor\_.txt, parser\_test1.txt, integration\_.txt)



**2. RUN TESTS**

Double-click "test\_runner.exe" or type in command line:



test\_runner.exe

That's it! No need to compile anything.



**USING THE TEST RUNNER**

When you run test\_runner.exe, you'll see a menu:







MAIN MENU

1\. Run ALL tests

2\. Run MEMORY tests

3\. Run PARSER tests

4\. Run EXECUTOR tests

5\. Run INTEGRATION tests

6\. Show test descriptions

7\. Get help

8\. Exit



Type a number (1-8) and press Enter.



**WHAT EACH TEST DOES**



MEMORY TESTS - Checks if variables are created, stored, and freed correctly



PARSER TESTS - Checks if program files are read correctly



EXECUTOR TESTS - Checks if commands (Mal, Ass, Add, etc.) work right



INTEGRATION TESTS - Checks if whole programs work end-to-end



**RUNNING INDIVIDUAL TESTS**

You can also run tests one at a time:



tests\_memory.exe

tests\_parser.exe

tests\_executor.exe

tests\_integration.exe



**UNDERSTANDING RESULTS**

If you see "Exit code: 0" - test passed



If you see "Exit code: 1" - test failed



Read the messages to see what went wrong



**IF TESTS FAIL**

Check the error messages



Make sure all .txt files are in the same folder



Check your interpreter code matches what the test expects



**FOR WINDOWS USERS**

Use .exe files as shown above



Everything should just work



**FOR LINUX/MAC USERS**

You need to compile from source:



text

gcc -o tests\_memory tests\_memory.c memory.c errors.c

gcc -o tests\_parser tests\_parser.c parser.c

gcc -o tests\_executor tests\_executor.c memory.c parser.c executor.c errors.c

gcc -o tests\_integration tests\_integration.c memory.c parser.c executor.c errors.c

gcc -o test\_runner test\_runner.c

Then run:



text

./test\_runner



**SOURCE CODE FOLDER**

If you want to see or change how tests work:



Look in the "src" folder



That has all the .c source files



You can modify them and recompile



**TROUBLESHOOTING**

Problem: "File not found"



Fix: Make sure all .txt files are in same folder as .exe files



Problem: Tests fail but your code seems to work



Fix: Check what the test expects vs what your code does



Problem: Permission errors



Fix: Try "Run as administrator" on Windows



**WORKFLOW FOR TESTING**

BEFORE making changes: Run all tests (option 1)



MAKE your changes to memory.c, parser.c, or executor.c



AFTER changes: Run tests again



IF tests fail: Fix your code until tests pass



**IMPORTANT**

Keep all .exe and .txt files together in one folder



Don't move .txt files to subfolders



The test runner needs to find the .txt files



NEED HELP?

Read "How to Test Me.txt" for more details about testing.



**SUMMARY**

Copy all files to your project



Run test\_runner.exe



Choose option 1 to test everything



Fix any problems until all tests pass



No compilation needed - just run the .exe files!
